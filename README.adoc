= HiveMQ 4 ‚Äì Example x509 Authentication Extension

== Purpose

This HiveMQ extension authenticates MQTT clients using x509 certificates. The extension evaluates the Issuer of the provided client certificate:

* If the Issuer is `alwaystrustme`, the client is fully authorized to access all topics with all permissions.
* If the Issuer differs, the extension does not authorize the client and passes the authentication process to the next available authenticator.
